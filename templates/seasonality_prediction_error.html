            <li>That the uploaded excel has a header,</li>
            <li>That it only has data in the first column</li>
            <li>And that the periodicity is a multiple of the lenght of the serie.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="seasonality-prediction-error-p">In the context of forecasting based on seasonality, it is crucial that
            the length of the series is a multiple of its periodicity. This rule ensures that the time series can be
            evenly divided into complete periods, which is essential for accurately calculating the seasonal components
            and making predictions.</p>
        <p class="seasonality-prediction-error-p">For example, imagine you have quarterly sales data for a company, and
            you want to use this data to forecast future sales. The periodicity for quarterly data is 4 (since there are
            4 quarters in a year).</p>
        <p class="seasonality-prediction-error-p">Valid Case: If you have sales data for 8 quarters (2 full years), the
            length of the series is 8. Therefore, the remainder of the division between 8 and 4 is zero, which means
            that the series can be evenly divided into full periods (2 years of quarterly data). This allows the
            function to accurately capture the seasonal pattern and make predictions.</p>
        <p class="seasonality-prediction-error-p">Invalid Case: If you have sales data for 7 quarters, the length of the
            series is 7. Here, the remainder of the division between 7 and 4 is 3. This means the series cannot be
            evenly divided into full periods, as it leaves a remainder. This incomplete period can distort the seasonal
            index calculations, leading to inaccurate forecasts.</p>
        <p class="seasonality-prediction-error-p">Therefore, ensuring that the length of the series is a multiple of its
            periodicity guarantees that the seasonal patterns are consistent and complete, which is fundamental for
            making reliable predictions based on seasonality.</p>
